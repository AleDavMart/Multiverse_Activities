TV Shows App: 

The purpose of this project was to build out a local server which would allow us to send requests. This app focuses on creating a database for shows which include properties like genre, seasons, and a rotten tomamtoes rating. Along with this we created Users which could add shows to their personal lists and rate them. Throughout this process we set the localhost:3000 channel to test the server and used postman to check our GET, PUT, and DELETE requests. 

Technologies needed: 
1. NPM 
2. SQlite3
3. Sequelize
4. Express
5. Jest - for testing //tests coming in the future...
6. Nodemon - to keep the server updated and running

Please install the dependencies by opening up Terminal on the project folder and running the following commands: 

    npm init
    npm install jest sequelize sqlite3 express nodemon

To Test the functions of the server, please use postman linked below. 
    Postman.com
